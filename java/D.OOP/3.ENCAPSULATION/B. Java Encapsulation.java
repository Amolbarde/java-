* Incapsulation:Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of how an 
  object works and only exposing what’s necessary through methods.

   knowing what's exactly inside or how it's made.

* Incapsulation doing using
   . private field(hide the data)
   . public getter/setter

  * Rules/Steps to Implement Encapsulation:
    .Make variables private
    .Provide public getter/setter methods
    .Keep logic inside setters/getters if needed (e.g., validation)

*9. Benefits of Encapsulation:
🔒 Data hiding
🛠 Easy to change code internally without affecting outside code
🚫 Prevents invalid data (via validation)
🧹 Makes code cleaner and modular
