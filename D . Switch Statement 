Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

Think of it like ordering food in a restaurant: If you choose number 1, you get Pizza. If you choose 2, you get a Burger. If you choose 3, you get Pasta. Otherwise, you get nothing.

The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:

syntax ---

switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
