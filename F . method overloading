ðŸ§¿ method 
- method is a block of code only run when it's called 

- Methods are used to perform         certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

ðŸ§¿ method creation 

  public class Main 
{
  static void myMethod()
 {
    // code to be executed
  }
}

ðŸ‘‰static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class.

ðŸ‘‰void means that this method does not have a return value

------------------------------------

ðŸ§¿ method overloading 
- method overloading means having multiple records with same name but different parameters list
_ With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters

Example

static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int myNum1 = plusMethodInt(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);
  System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);
  System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
}
